                I, Robot is a fixup collection made up of science fiction short stories by American writer Isaac Asimov.
                The stories originally appeared in the American magazines Super Science Stories and Astounding Science
                Fiction between 1940 and 1950 and were then collected into a 1950 publication Gnome Press in 1950, in an
                initial edition of 5,000 copies.

                Summary
                The nine stories are linked by a framing narrative involving a reporter’s interview with Susan Calvin, a
                former robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., whose work involved dysfunctional
                robots and the problems inherent in human-robot interactions. The stories centre on problems that arise
                from the ethical programming, summed up in Asimov’s famed Three Laws of Robotics:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

                </li>
                <li>
                    A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with
                    the
                    First Law.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First
                    and
                    Second Laws.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The first story, “ Robbie,” is set in 1998 and centres on a little girl, Gloria, who loves her nursemaid
                robot, Robbie. Her mother comes to believe that robots are unsafe, however, and Robbie is returned to
                the factory. Gloria is heartbroken. In an effort to show her that robots are machines, not people, her
                parents take her to see robots being assembled at a factory. One of the assembling robots is Robbie.
                Gloria endangers her life running to Robbie, and Robbie rescues Gloria, persuading Gloria’s mother that
                robots can be trusted.
